### Technologies used

- Visual Studio Code
- Node.js


#### What we learned 
We learned how to refactor javascript code to use modern syntax, destructure objects, convert functions to arrow functions, and utilize `for..in` and `for..of` loops. I also practiced creating and importing Node.js-compatible modules and using the spread operator in our code.
